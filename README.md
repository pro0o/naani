## Info
Naani was born out of an idea to reduce the hassle for people in many remote areas of Nepal to instantly check for cataracts using just a photo of their eye. </br> With the growing accessibility of mobile phones, itâ€™s now a more practical solution than traveling to urban areas for a checkup. Fr a genuine effort from our side.
